# Protein Classifier Neural Network
## The Neural Network
This network predicts the proteins of an amino acid sequence based on an initial codon list and based on a built-in dataset. The network is fully densely connected and uses a sparse categorical crossentropy loss function since the dataset is categorical (the model predicts one of the possible protein classes). The neural network uses a standard Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The model's architecture contains:
- 1 Input Layer (with 3 input neurons)
- 12 Hidden Layers (with either 128, 256, or 1024 neurons and a standard ReLU activation function)
- 1 Output Layer (with 22 output neurons)

Feel free to hyperparameter tune the model or experiment with the dataset!

## The Dataset
The data is generated within the python file and consists of 100 sets of 64 codons (there are 64 to represent all codons equally since there are 64 unique codons). Each codon is represented as a list of [base, base, base] and is an input (x value) that is fed into the neural network; that's why the input shape of the network is 3. Labels (y values) are generated by transcribing and translating those codons into their correct classes (each class is a protein) to and is represented as [number] where "number" is some value between 0 and 21 (inclusive) since there are 22 proteins (and thus 22 classes). This is why the output layer of the network has 22 neurons.

#### Dataset Generation Process Example 
1. Get untranscripted and untranslated codon
      - TAC
2. Encode the codon (this is the input fed into the neural network)
      -  [2, 1, 4] (T : 2, A : 1, C : 4)
3. Transcribe the codon (this is a hidden step to achieve a more accurate label; the neural network does not "see" this step)
      - TAC ==> AUG
      - [2, 1, 4] ==> [1, 5, 3]
4. Translate the codon into a class (this is the output the neural network trains on)
      - AUG ==> Methionine
      - [1, 5, 3] ==> [0]
